`XTRIM` trims the stream to a given number of items, evicting older items
(items with lower IDs) if needed. The command is conceived to accept multiple
trimming strategies, however currently only a single one is implemented,
which is `MAXLEN`, and works exactly as the `MAXLEN` option in `XADD`.

For example the following command will trim the stream to exactly
the latest 1000 items:

```
XTRIM mystream MAXLEN 1000
```

By default, or when provided with the optional `=` argument, the command
performs exact trimming. That means that the trimmed stream's length will be
exactly the minimum between its original length and the specified maximum
length.

It is possible to give the command in the following special form in
order to make it more efficient:

```
XTRIM mystream MAXLEN ~ 1000
```

The `~` argument between the **MAXLEN** option and the actual count means that
the user is not really requesting that the stream length is exactly 1000 items,
but instead it could be a few tens of entries more, but never less than 1000
items. When this option modifier is used, the trimming is performed only when
Redis is able to remove a whole macro node. This makes it much more efficient,
and it is usually what you want.

@return

@integer-reply, specifically:

The command returns the number of entries deleted from the stream.

```cli
XADD mystream * field1 A field2 B field3 C field4 D
XTRIM mystream MAXLEN 2
XRANGE mystream - +
```
