Appends the specified stream entry to the stream at the specified key.
If the key does not exist, as a side effect of running this command the
key is created with a stream value. The creation of stream's key can be
disabled with the `NOMKSTREAM` option.

An entry is composed of a set of field-value pairs, it is basically a
small dictionary. The field-value pairs are stored in the same order
they are given by the user, and commands to read the stream such as
`XRANGE` or `XREAD` are guaranteed to return the fields and values
exactly in the same order they were added by `XADD`.

`XADD` is the *only Redis command* that can add data to a stream, but 
there are other commands, such as `XDEL` and `XTRIM`, that are able to
remove data from a stream.

## Specifying a Stream ID as an argument

A stream entry ID identifies a given entry inside a stream.
The `XADD` command will auto-generate a unique ID for you if the ID argument
specified is the `*` character (asterisk ASCII character). However, while
useful only in very rare cases, it is possible to specify a well-formed ID, so
that the new entry will be added exactly with the specified ID.

IDs are specified by two numbers separated by a `-` character:

    1526919030474-55

Both quantities are 64-bit numbers. When an ID is auto-generated, the
first part is the Unix time in milliseconds of the Redis instance generating
the ID. The second part is just a sequence number and is used in order to
distinguish IDs generated in the same millisecond.

IDs are guaranteed to be always incremental: If you compare the ID of the
entry just inserted it will be greater than any other past ID, so entries
are totally ordered inside a stream. In order to guarantee this property,
if the current top ID in the stream has a time greater than the current
local time of the instance, the top entry time will be used instead, and
the sequence part of the ID incremented. This may happen when, for instance,
the local clock jumps backward, or if after a failover the new master has
a different absolute time.

When a user specified an explicit ID to `XADD`, the minimum valid ID is
`0-1`, and the user *must* specify an ID which is greater than any other
ID currently inside the stream, otherwise the command will fail. Usually
resorting to specific IDs is useful only if you have another system generating
unique IDs (for instance an SQL table) and you really want the Redis stream
IDs to match the one of this other system.

## Capped streams

It is possible to limit the size of the stream to a maximum number of
elements using the **MAXLEN** option. By default, or when used with the `=`
argument, the **MAXLEN** option performs an exact trimming. That means that the
trimmed stream's length will be exactly the minimum between its original length
and the specified maximum length.

Trimming with **MAXLEN** can be expensive compared to just adding entries with 
`XADD`: streams are represented by macro nodes into a radix tree, in order to
be very memory efficient. Altering the single macro node, consisting of a few
tens of elements, is not optimal. So it is possible to give the command in the
following special form:

    XADD mystream MAXLEN ~ 1000 * ... entry fields here ...

The `~` argument between the **MAXLEN** option and the actual count means that
the user is not really requesting that the stream length is exactly 1000 items,
but instead it could be a few tens of entries more, but never less than 1000
items. When this option modifier is used, the trimming is performed only when
Redis is able to remove a whole macro node. This makes it much more efficient,
and it is usually what you want.

@return

@bulk-string-reply, specifically:

The command returns the ID of the added entry. The ID is the one auto-generated
if `*` is passed as ID argument, otherwise the command just returns the same ID
specified by the user during insertion.

The command returns a @nil-reply when used with the `NOMKSTREAM` option and the
key doesn't exist.

@history

* `>= 6.2`: Added the `NOMKSTREAM` option.
